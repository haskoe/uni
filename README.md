II. Tasks:
Answer the questions below by using the data in the file mentioned above. Create PowerPoint
slides that address the questions below so that you can present the answers in the afternoon
on Wednesday, September, the 25th. Students not being affiliated with a group should contact
Alex ASAP.
1. Paste your exported nutrient intake data from the Cronometer evaluation for each of
the three DAMs applied into a row labelled with your ID number that you obtained
from Anne. Do NOT include the individual students’ data from individual days from
the 4-day weighed food record into the result-reporting sheet in the Google
Docs/Excel document but only the averaged values over the 4 days! Please be
aware that even the fastest student can start the evaluation first AFTER ALL
STUDENTS HAVE ADDED THEIR DATA!
2. Calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR) based on the modified Harris–Benedict
equations in their actualized version by Roza and Shizgal (1984) individually for each
student: • Males: BMR = 88.36 + (13.40 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) -
(5.677 x age in years) • Females: BMR = 447.6 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x
height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years) Paste the result in all three data sheets in the last
column in the Google spreadsheets in the same row as your nutrient intake data.
From this step on, download for each group a copy of the nutrient intake files
from each DAM so that you can address group-internally the following points:
3. Calculate the relative fulfillment of the recommended intake (RI) of each nutrient on
the basis of the (new) Nordic Nutrition Recommendations
(https://pub.norden.org/nord2023-003/overviewof-nutrients.html ) of the Nordic
Nutrition Council (NNC) in the corresponding columns within the Excel datasheets.
Remember to use the appropriate sex-specific value for each student. Keep the
following conversion factors in mind when comparing the reported and the
recommended values: Vitamin A, 1 International Unit (IU) retinol = 0.3 μg retinol
equivalents; Vitamin D, 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg vitamin D.
Please also run a check on feasibility and exclude numbers that cannot hold true (e.g.
unrealistic energy intake values).
4. Calculate the average values, the standard deviations (SD), and the standard error of
mean (SEM) for the intakes of all nutrients evaluated (absolute and relative values of
macronutrients and alcohol, absolute values of micronutrients, and the individual
relative fulfillment of recommended intakes for micronutrients) separately for
a. the FFQ,
b. the 24-h recall, and
c. the 4-day weighed food record.
This is done to be able to integrate both the absolute and the relative fulfillment
values in a graphical format to be used for your presentations on September the 25th.
In the case of micronutrients, the relative values are to be expressed as the relative
fulfillment of the RI values from the NNRs. For the macronutrients (including
2

alcohol), the relative values refer to the individual energy intake. For this purpose,
assume the following energy contents: carbs/proteins: 4.0 kcal/g; fat: 9.0 kcal/g;
alcohol: 6.9 kcal/g; fibre: 2.0 kcal/g.
5. In the corresponding groups, utilizing the statistics from Task 4, generate column
charts with error bars indicating average values +/- SEM representing the relative
intake of macronutrients (including alcohol; including total fat and SFA, PUFA,
MUFA, w-3- and w-6-FA) expressed as energy percentages (E%) for each of the
applied methods (FFQ, 24-h recall, and the averaged 4-day weighed food record),
along with markers of the acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDRs) as
red lines along with appropriate headers (3 figures in total). Example:

6. In the corresponding groups, utilizing the statistics from Task 4, generate column
charts with error bars indicating average values +/- SEM representing the relative
intake of micronutrients (including vitamins, minerals, and trace elements)
expressed as achieved percentages (%) of the NNR RI values for each of the
applied methods (FFQ, 24-h recall, the averaged 4-day MUFA, and the weighed food
record). Include a horizontal red line into the chart indicating the 100% value (3
figures in total, each with a self-explanatory header). Example:

7. Generate a concluding slide in which you assess (i) the comparability of the 3
methods and (ii) which of the nutrients you investigated deserves particular attention
by being either under- or over-consumed.
8. Be ready to present the results (and the slides) in the afternoon of our practical lessons
on Sept., the 25th, starting at 14:30.
9. Repeat the evaluation of the data for the members of your group only so that you have
the estimated energy intakes, the relative fulfillments of the recommended intake
values on micronutrients and minerals, and the average MDRs available. You do not
need to prepare the charts (or slides) for this evaluation.
10. The report (max. 5 pages) to be handed in should include:
a. The course name and ID, a title of the report, and the names of the authors
who participated in the data processing and report writing
b. Introduction and study setting: one short paragraph describing the study
setting, the methods applied, and the purpose of the study (5-6 sentences, 1⁄2 a
page max.).
c. Graphical and summarizing presentation of the results: the six charts with
appropriate legends making the content of the charts clear. Place 2 charts with
individual legends explaining the content of the chart on each page (3 pages in
total). Summarize the content of the charts within 1⁄2 a page in total. Focus
hereby particularly on the nutrient intakes that you consider to be critical.
d. brief, descriptive analogous evaluation of the within-group data including a
half-page long conclusion on (i) the comparability of the results across the
three applied DAMs (i.e. with respect to the quality of the data), (ii) a
conclusion on under which premises you would apply which method, (iii)
the differences between the evaluation of the class and your group (Are
there substantial differences between the class-based and the group-based
results?), and (iv) an overall conclusion on which nutrients you consider to be
critical for the class and/or working group and which nutrition advice you
delineate from this (one page max.)
The report is to be handed in on October the 1st, noon.
