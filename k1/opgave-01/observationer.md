Suggestions:
. Dont use Excel
. Gender, height and weight in separate sheet to facilitate auto calculation of bmr
. Individual student data in separate csv files named <student no.>.csv and concatenation into one csv file with proper validations
. No mean calculation on 4-day csv
. RI values in separate sheet, actual unit in separate row, units removed from values, min and max values in separate rows
