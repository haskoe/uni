Suggestions:
. Dont use Excel
. consistent column names
. Always column names in first row
. Stud_nr, Sex, height and weight in separate sheet to facilitate auto calculation of bmr, remove Sex from ffq, 24-hour and 4-days
. Individual student data in separate csv files named <student no.>.csv and concatenation into one csv file with proper validations
. No mean calculation on 4-day csv
. RI values in separate sheet, actual unit in separate row, units removed from values, min, recommended and max values (and possibly more i.e. mean, +/-1 SD) in separate rows
. B12 and Folate names messed up in 4-days and 24-hour
. Female in upper case !!!
